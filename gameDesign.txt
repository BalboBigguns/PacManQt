Pac-Man is a 2d, top down camera style maze game.
The player eats dots in the maze, and must evade ghosts.  If the player eats big dots then the player can eat the ghosts for a short time.

Pac-Man
----------------
The player controls Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a mouth that eats dots.
If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, a life is lost and Pac-Man repawns.
If Pac-Man recently ate a big dot and collides with a ghost he will not only stay alive but also eat the ghost, earning points.
If all lives are lost the game is over.  The game begins with 3 lives.

Dots
----------------
Dots are placed periodically on the pathways between the maze walls, and when Pac-Man eats all the dots,
the game levels up, the dots are replaced, and the ghosts and Pac-Man are respawed.
The dots in the four corners of the maze are big dots.
When Pac-Man eats a big dot, he can eat ghosts for a short period of time and earn points.

Ghosts
----------------
The ghosts are spawned in a ghost pen area.
The ghosts wander the maze, and when Pac-Man is in sight, they chase him until he is out of sight.
If a ghost collides with Pac-Man a life is lost and Pac-Man is respawned.
If Pac-Man eats a big dot the ghosts run away from him until he can no longer eat them.
If a ghost is eaten by Pac-Man the ghost is momentarily respawned.

Fruits
----------------
Fruits appear periodically on the Pac-man spawn point.
If Pac-Man eats a fruit then points are earned.

Maze
----------------
Pac-Man and the ghosts cannot walk through the maze walls.
If a ghost or Pac-Man walks to the edge of the map, they are wrapped around to the other side.
